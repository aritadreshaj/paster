By covering SNCF railway tracks, a 3,100 m2 site is unlocked for mixed-use development, combining residential, commercial, office, and park spaces. This densification strengthens the historical and industrial fabric while creating new connections, including to the 13th arrondissement. The design reimagines urban living, balancing privacy and community through diverse housing models. Shared spaces and natural environments promote social interaction. The project emphasizes sustainability with bioclimatic principles, focusing on mobility, resilient architecture, energy efficiency, biodiversity, and adaptable structures.",

    "description": "In the 1970s, O. M. Ungers described Berlin as an archipelago of different urban realities. The image of Berlin today is different. The city has grown, linked itself and finds a superordinate reality. Some urban spaces remain vacant for years, only to be exploited by a profit-driven market—an archipelago of voids in contrast to Ungers’ vision.  New Archipelafo fundamentally criticizes typical market visions, giving a voice to voids and testing new approaches. Decades of misuse drived us to propose a radical vision prioritizing free space and protected urban nature. We challenged conventional sustainability, rejecting greenwashing and lifestyle architecture in favor of a framework for true co-existence, both visually and conceptually.",

By minimizing CO2 emissions, preserving historical narratives, and engaging local communities, the design fosters social responsibility. Sustainable materials and biodiversity conservation shape a home where furniture, fixtures, and personal artifacts define the space. More than a renovation, this project encodes domestic spaces as cultural expressions, ensuring they reflect both history and the evolving needs of their inhabitants.",

The design introduces bold, modern duplex apartments that offer diverse living experiences through expressive spatial organization, rhythm, and materiality. Serving as a visual mediator between two contrasting urban environments, the building captures the energy of the city across its dual facades. The new design replaces monotony with movement, obliquely arranged balconies in low-impact cementitious material animate the elevation, their textured surfaces softened by warm tones. A geometric play of black metal profiles disrupts the sleek glass, creating a bold, sustainable, and visually dynamic composition.",
